#This is for MCDA5520 Python Assignment (A00474880)

Included are answers and all required inputs for all three questions with Q1Q2 in one file, and Q3 in a separate python file.

I've also included an environment.yml file in case it doesn't run on grader's machine. To set up the environment, please run:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    
If you want to specify a different path than system default please use the -p flag followed by the required path:

    conda env create -f environment.yml -p /home/user/anaconda3/envs/env_name
